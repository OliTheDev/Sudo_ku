<p>a humorus take on the classic puzzle game. displayed in classic terminal green.
if you are not familiar with how the game works please see ______
</p>

<h3 id="terms">termanology</h3>

<ol>
<li>cell = a single point on the grid.</li>
<li>box = a sub grid of the grid containing 9 cells</li>
<li>grid = the entire board consisting of 81 cell divided into 9 boxes</li>
</ol>




<h3 id="datamod">1.Data</h3>

<h4 id="map">1.1 map</h4>
<table>
 <tr>
  <th>type</th> <th>Map() object</th> 
 <tr>  
  <th>scope</th> <th>global</th>
 </tr>  
</table>
<p>this serves as the source of truth for what each cell contains.
the enclosed key/value pairs represent the current game state.
each key corrisponds to an ID tag for the HTML element representing that cell on the board.
these ID have specific stucure that encapsulates cymantic data explained in the ID structures explained in section 1.1.1 

</p>
<table>
<th>contents</th><th>type</th><th>cymantics</th>
 </tr>
<tr>
<th>key</th><th>string</th><th>corrisponds with an ID tag for a cell</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>value</th><th>number</th><th>contents of cell with 0 being empty</th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

 



<h4 id="layout">1.1.1 ID structure</h4>
given just an elements id we need to know three things. <ul><li>what box it's in</li><li> what row it's in</li> <li>what column it's in?</li></ul><br>
this means each id will consist of three characters that can be extrapolated to reviel the above information.<br> 
the first 2 characters will signify which box the cell is located within.<br>
the first character can only be one of three letters a, b and c each representing the row of the containing box.<br>
the second character can only be one of three letters d, e, and f each representing which column the containing box is in.<br>
a visual example is given below as to how the grid is subdivided.  <br>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>AD</th>
		<th>AE</th>
		<th>AF</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>BD</th>
		<th>BE</th>
		<th>BF</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>CD</th>
		<th>CE</th>
		<th>CF</th>
</tr>
</table>

<p> the final character is a number representing the specific cell within that subgrid going left to right top to bottom.<br>
an example would ad1 which represents the top most call on the far left.<br>
so the AD subgrid would look like this</p>


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>ad1</th>
		<th>ad2</th>
		<th>ad3</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>ad4</th>
		<th>ad5</th>
		<th>ad6</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>ad7</th>
		<th>ad8</th>
		<th>ad9</th>
</tr>
</table>


<h4 id="board">1.2 board</h4>

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>type</th> <th>Vector/nested array</th> 
 <tr>  
  <th>scope</th> <th>global</th>
 </tr>  
<tr>
 <th>content type</th> <th>number </th>
</table>

<p>this is the starting point for the game. 


<h4 id="datatype">Data types</h4>
<p>the game is played on a 9 by 9 grid this mean 81 indavidual cells. Each cell will have a containing value
the other piece of information we need to keep track of is the containing number within each cell.<br>
In this case we use 0 to represent an empty cell so the contenets will only ever be a sinlge digit.<br>
the result of this is 81 key value pairs that will be constantly updated.<br>
because of these needs a hashmap is the ideal datastructure.<br>
It is simply named map and placed in the global scope.
</p>




the game is played by adding numbers to a grid. some cells in this grid already have number that cannot be changed. when a number is added there are three<br>
requirements it must satify. the number being added my not appear anywhere else in the same row. the number being added my not appear anywhere else in the same column<br>
and lastly the number being added my not appear anywhere else in the same subgrid. the game is finished when all the cells of the grid are filled.  

there are three layers to every project. data, logic and presentation. I think its important to go through them in tha order. so
