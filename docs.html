<p>A classic puzzle game played inside a web browser.</p>


<h3 id="datamod">Data modeling</h3>

<h4 id="layout">Board Layout</h4>
<p> the game is played on a 9 by 9 grid this mean 81 indavidual cells. Each cell is a div with a unique Id tag that gives key information about its location within the grid.<br>
given just this id we need to know three things. <ul><li>what box or subgrid it's in</li><li> what row it's in</li> <li>what column it's in?</li></ul><br>
this means each id will consist of three characters that can be extrapolated to reviel the above information.<br> 
the first 2 characters will signify which box the cell is located within.<br>
the first character can only be one of three letters a, b and c each representing the row of the containing box.<br>
the second character can only be one of three letters d, e, and f each representing which column the containing box is in.<br>
a visual example is given below as to how the grid is subdivided.  <br>
 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>AD</th>
		<th>AE</th>
		<th>AF</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>BD</th>
		<th>BE</th>
		<th>BF</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>CD</th>
		<th>CE</th>
		<th>CF</th>
</tr>
</table>

<p> the final character is a number representing the specific cell within that subgrid going left to right top to bottom.<br>
an example would ad1 which represents the top most call on the far left.<br>
so the AD subgrid would look like this</p>


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>ad1</th>
		<th>ad2</th>
		<th>ad3</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>ad4</th>
		<th>ad5</th>
		<th>ad6</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>ad7</th>
		<th>ad8</th>
		<th>ad9</th>
</tr>
</table>



<h4 id="datatype">Data Type</h4>
<p>the other piece of information we need to keep track of is the containing number within each cell.<br>
In this case we use 0 to represent an empty cell so the contenets will only ever be a sinlge digit.<br>
the result of this is 81 key value pairs that will be constantly updated.<br>
because of these needs a hashmap is the ideal datastructure.<br>
It is simply named map and placed in the global scope.
