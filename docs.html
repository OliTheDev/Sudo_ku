<h2 id="desc"> Description</h2>
<p>A humorus take on the classic puzzle game displayed in terminal green. 
</p>

<h2 id="help">How To Play</h2>
<p>fill a 9x9 grid of cells with numbers 1-9, ensuring each number appears only once in every row, column, and 3x3 subgrid (or "box").
Each new game begins with different cells already filled in, these numbers cannot be changed. The game is finished when all the cells of the grid are filled.  


<h2 id="datamod">1.Data</h2>

<h3 id="layout">1.1 ID structure</h3>
<p>
Since the game is played on a 9x9 grid that means 81 cells. Each of these cells will be its own HTML element with a unique ID tag. 
If given just this ID tag we need to know three things about the cell that element represents. <ul><li>what box it's in</li><li> what row it's in</li> <li>what column it's in?</li></ul><br>

The protocol to encapsulate this cymantic information is as follows </p>

<p>
Each ID must have a length of 3 characters(2 letters and 1 number).
the first 2 characters will signify which box the cell is located within.<br>
the first character can only be one of three letters a, b and c each representing the row of the containing box.<br>
the second character can only be one of three letters d, e, and f each representing which column the containing box is in.<br>
a visual example is given below as to how the grid is subdivided.  <br>
</p>

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>AD</th>
		<th>AE</th>
		<th>AF</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>BD</th>
		<th>BE</th>
		<th>BF</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>CD</th>
		<th>CE</th>
		<th>CF</th>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
<p class="inline"> the final character is a number representing the specific cell within that subgrid going left to right top to bottom.<br>
an example <p class="fill">ad1</p> which represents the top most cell on the far left.<br>
The AD subgrid would look like this</p>


<table>
	<tr>
		<th>ad1</th>
		<th>ad2</th>
		<th>ad3</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>ad4</th>
		<th>ad5</th>
		<th>ad6</th>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>ad7</th>
		<th>ad8</th>
		<th>ad9</th>
</tr>
</table>



<h3 id="map">1.2 map</h3>
<table>
 <tr>
  <th>type</th> <th>Hashmap/Map() object</th> 
 <tr>  
  <th>scope</th> <th>global</th>
 </tr>  
</table>
<p class="inline">
<p class="fill">map</p> serves as the current game state. Each of its contained key/value pairs corrispond to an HTML elements ID tag and the contenets of that element respectivly.

</p>
<table>
<th>contents</th><th>type</th><th>max length</th><th>cymantics</th>
 </tr>
<tr>
<th>key</th><th>string</th><th>3</th><th>corrisponds with an ID tag for a cell</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>value</th><th>number</th><th>1</th><th>contents of cell with 0 being empty</th>
</tr>
</table>
<p>

 




<h3 id="board">1.2 board</h3>

<table>
 <tr>
  <th>type</th> <th>Vector/nested array</th> 
 <tr>  
  <th>scope</th> <th>global</th>
 </tr>  
<tr>
 <th>content type</th> <th>number </th>
</table>
<p class="inline"><p class="fill">board</p> represents which cells will be filled in at the start of a new game. While there can only be one <p class="fill">board</p> in the global scope its contenets may be updated 
so a new game can be started with different cells filled in at the beginning   
<br>
<p class="inline">a new board object is fed into <p class="fill">map</p> using the aggregate() function.</p>



<h4 id="datatype">Data types</h4>





there are three layers to every project. data, logic and presentation. I think its important to go through them in tha order. so
